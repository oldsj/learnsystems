## Learning Systems Programming: Rust vs C

I've been wanting to learn systems programming for a long time now. I've read a lot about the rust programming language and have been dying to dive into it but have found that most tutorials online get kind of tough to follow fot those of us who don't have a C/C++ background. So, I found a copy of [The C Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) on Amazon for 4 bucks and will be learning both C and Rust at the same time by doing the excercises in Kernighan & Ritchie's highly praised 2nd edititon book in both C and Rust side by side.
